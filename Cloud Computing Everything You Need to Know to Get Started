# 1.    Problems with on-premises infrastructure
- **Large capital investment:** IT teams need to spend a large amount of money setting up hardware, servers, storage networking, operating systems, applications, and data in their on-premises infrastructure. Purchasing and installments involve a large up-front capital investment.
- **Capacity planning:** IT teams need to start guessing the capacity of the project. Chances are that the team may end up with overutilization or underutilization of resources due to incorrect up-front capacity planning.
- **Not Scalable:** On-premises infrastructure resources canâ€™t be scaled up or down based on business needs. Hence, it is very difficult to incorporate rapidly changing business requirements. This makes on-premises infrastructure highly unreliable.
- **Low availability:** On-premises data canters are not highly available as they are located in a single geographical location. Any disaster will significantly impact operations due to a lack of high availability across multiple regions.
