# 1.	Introduction to machine learning
You might be wondering, “How do machines learn? In fact, in machine learning, we train a computer system to identify patterns in historical data. This pattern recognition will help make predictions based on the new data when it is provided. These predictions will help you make effective business decisions.

Datasets are used to train a model. Features and labels are two important parts of datasets. Features will act as input, whereas labels will act as output. The goal of the algorithm is to take features as input and find a formula that predicts labels as output. This way, algorithms take new data, recognize patterns in the data, apply the formula, and make predictions about the data.
# 2.	Introduction to Generative AI
Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) is a branch of machine learning (ML). It deals with the creation of algorithms that can create natural language text, images, stories, code, audio, and videos based on user input. Generative AI has numerous applications in various industries, such as media, entertainment, healthcare, and finance.
Generative AI is a subset of deep learning as it can adapt various models without retraining. Deep learning is based on the concept of neurons and synapses, which are related to the human brain. Generative AI is backed by a large language model (LLM).These models are pretrained on a large volume of data sets. These models are called foundation models (FMs).
In traditional ML, we gather labeled data for each model and train multiple models. In FMs, instead of using different models, we use the same model to perform various tasks.
Large language models (LLM) can be used to predict the next word in the sentence by taking into consideration the context of the word in the sentence.

**Examples:**
- **Amazon CodeWhisperer** is an example of a generative AI application. It can generate code suggestions in real time based on your comments and existing code.
- **ChatGPT** an AI language model developed by OpenAI. It can answer questions and generate human-like responses from text prompts.
- **Google Bard** an AI Chatbot. It can answer questions and generate human-like responses from text prompts.
